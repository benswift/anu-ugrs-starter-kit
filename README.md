# ANU Research Student Starter Kit

If you're taking on an undergraduate research project as part of the [c/c/c
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/), then here's a starter
repo to help with some of the admin stuff.

## TODO

1. fork this repo to your own github account (probably best to make it
   private---this will remove the fork relationship, but that's fine)

2. add your supervisor (e.g. [@benswift](https://github.com/benswift/)) as a
   collaborator (under _Settings_ > _Manage access_)

3. start writing up your project metadata, description & learning outcomes in
   `admin/independent-study-contract.md`

4. write up a personal bio for the [c/c/c studio people
   page](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/people/)

There will be more documents & admin stuff to write over the course of your
project, which you can add to this repo as you go. It means everything'll be in
one place, it'll be easy for your supervisor to review/give feedback, and it'll
be backed up in case you spill coffee on your laptop.

Finally, a **quick warning**: the "final word" on admin requirements in your
project course is always your project course convenor, so if there's ever a
conflict between what they say and what's written here (e.g. if this info gets
out-of-date) then go with what they say.

And if you have any questions, just email [Ben](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
